# Conways Game Of Life

Much has already been written about the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) so I won't describe it here. This is a simple (no dependencies) browser based implementation of the game.

Currently, you can:
  * click to make a square "alive".
  * click and drag to make many squares "alive".
  * start and stop the simulation.

One day perhaps I'll add more features, and expose the simulation paramters to the interface. Cross your fingers for that!

[Enjoy the simulation](https://teb311.github.io/conways-game-of-life/)
